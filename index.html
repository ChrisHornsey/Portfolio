                I am currently learning the fundatmentals of web development in my spare time as a hobby. 
                Having grown up with the internet I've never really understood what is happening "in the background", and I felt it was time to change that. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently working through the full stack web development course over at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">codecademy</a>.
                As such most of the projects I have built are related to exercises as part of that course (including this page!)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also have a passion for tabletop gaming, espcially Arkham Horror the Card Game by Fantasy Flight Games (if you haven't played it before, you should check it out!).
                You may find that my enthusiasm for that games spills over into the example projects I'm building too ;).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For instance check out this cool picture of the investigator Jim Culver opposite. He has a magical trumpet that causes the dead to rise!

                This was a project written using HTML & CSS, the aim of this project was to develop and display a coherent style guide for my work to follow.
                Does it look like it is working?

                This project was written using Javascript, as such just the code is in the linked repo, no fun page to play with currently :(.
                The aim for the project was to develop some Javascript which would return a random string from a set of lists of various components.

                This project was written using HTML & CSS, the aim here was to develop a website for a fictional business.
                I chose to build a PI agency for some of my favourite characters from the game!
                From a technical point of view, this project utilises CSS FlexBox to help with the layout. 
                It also has several CSS @media queries to ensure the page display well on mobile devices, as well as full sized monitors.
