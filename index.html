                I am currently learning the fundatmentals of web development in my spare time as a hobby. 
                Having grown up with the internet I've never really understood what is happening "in the background", and I felt it was time to change that. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working through the full stack web development course over at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">codecademy</a>.
                As such most of the projects I ahve built are related to exercises as part of that course (including this page!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a passion for tabletop gaming, espcially Arkham Horror the Card Game by Fantasy Flight Games (if you haven't played it before, you should check it out!).
                You may find that my enthusiasm for that games spills over into the example projects I'm building too ;).
